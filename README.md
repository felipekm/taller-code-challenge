# Taller JavaScript challenge

## How to run to get the results
The repository contains two files and it can be executed using NodeJS, eg:

- `node non-constructible-change.js`
- `node sorted-squared-array.js`

---

## Description

### Non-Constructible Change

> Given an array of positive integers representing the values of coins in your possession, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the  minimum sum of money) that you  CANNOT create. The given coins can have
any positive integer value and aren't necessarily unique (i.e., you can have multiple coins of the same value).

#### First Test case

- Input: `[5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]`
- Output: `20`


#### Second Test Case

- Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Output: `6`

#### Third Test Case

- Input: `[1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 10, 15, 20, 100]`
- Output: `55`

---

### Sorted Squared Array
> Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers that are sorted  in ascending order and returns a new array of the same length with the squares  of the original integers also sorted in ascending order.

#### First Test Case

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9]`
- Output: `[1, 4, 9, 25, 36, 64, 81]`


#### Second Test Case

- Input: `[-2, -1]`
- Output: `[1, 4]`


#### Third Test Case

- Input: `[-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]`
- Output: `[0, 25, 25, 100, 100]`
